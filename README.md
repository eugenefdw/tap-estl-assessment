# tap-estl-assessment
This repository is for the GovTech Technology Associate Programme (TAP) 2021 Take Home Assessment from ETL, due 14 October 2020.

## How to start
Ensure the following is installed:
- Docker version 19
- npm version 6.14.8

1. Run `docker-compose up` in root folder.
- If first time running, terminate docker after db instance logs: "database systen is ready to accept connections", and run `docker-compose up` again. This is to ensure the database instance is fully initialised.
2. Run `npm install` in \frontend folder
3. Run `npm start` in \frontend folder

## Misc
Due to relative lack of experience, the example site created at https://github.com/eugenefdw/to-do-site, which uses the guide from https://hassansaleh.info/,  will be used as the basis for this assessment submission. The tutorial uses a PERN stack, and roughly teaches how to use Docker for deployment.

Major credit to @m4dkip and @DigiPie for discussions and help with postgres, especially with confirming that my schemas and queries aren't too weird
