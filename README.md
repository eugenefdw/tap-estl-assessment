# tap-estl-assessment
This repository is for the GovTech Technology Associate Programme (TAP) 2021 Take Home Assessment from ETL, due 14 October 2020.

## How to start
1. TODO

## Design decisions
Due to relative lack of experience, the example site created at https://github.com/eugenefdw/to-do-site, which uses the guide from https://hassansaleh.info/,  will be used as the basis for this assessment submission. The tutorial uses a PERN stack, and roughly teaches how to use Docker for deployment.

Any design decisions, deviations and learning resources used during this process will be listed below as I create the application.


npm version 6.14.8
docker desktop for windows 2.4.0.0 running through WSL 2
docker version 19.03.13, build 4484c46d9d

checking postgres encoding - unknown how db is set up automatically by docker, how table is added immediately
